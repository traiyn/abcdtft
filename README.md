## A, B, C, D, TFT. HI. JK. LMAO...P


Jokes aside, this is a sandbox to explore one of my favorite games (if time spent == enjoyment), Teamfight Tactics! Also known as "TFT".

### What is TFT?

Teamfight Tactics is a PvP strategy spinoff of the popular MOBA, League of Legends. Labeled as an "auto-chess" game, the concept is to build a team to beat the other 7 players. Or, at least finish in the top 4. You will compete against your opponents in a round-robin fashion, with some bonus rounds at various levels to introduce new items or other game altering components.

At a high level, there is a pool of **champions** with various synergies amongst them determined by their **traits**. You can buy and sell champions to change or improve your team composition. **Items** allow you to boost the champions that hold them. There is an ever-changing meta with routine patches, often to balance champions, items, or traits. There are even grander changes between "Sets", where a different list of champions, items, and traits altogether may be introduced. This requires competitive players to be adaptive if they want to climb the ladder.

### What are you building?

There are a number of websites that do fantastic analytics against the Riot API to determine best team compositions (comps), item optimization, and gold spending/saving strategies. My goal is not to beat or match those sites, but to simply leverage a hobby of mine to build a modern data pipeline for my own edification. This pipeline leverages the Riot API to access game summary data.
